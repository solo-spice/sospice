sospice documentation
=====================

`SPICE <https://spice.ias.u-psud.fr/>`__ is an extreme-UV imaging
spectrometer on board the `Solar
Orbiter <http://sci.esa.int/solar-orbiter/>`__ mission.

``sospice`` is intended to be a simple way of accessing all necessary
functionalities required for day-to-day SPICE data analysis. This
package is in its early stages of development. Please see the
`issues <https://github.com/solo-spice/sospice/issues>`__ to see how you
can contribute.

A generic SPICE data analysis user’s manual (including Python and IDL
tips) is available `on the IAS
wiki <https://spice-wiki.ias.u-psud.fr/doku.php/data:data_analysis_manual>`__.
