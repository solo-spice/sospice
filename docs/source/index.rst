sospice documentation
=====================

`SPICE <https://spice.ias.u-psud.fr/>`__ is an extreme-UV imaging
spectrometer on board the `Solar
Orbiter <http://sci.esa.int/solar-orbiter/>`__ mission.
A generic SPICE data analysis user’s manual (including Python and IDL
tips) is available `on the IAS
wiki <https://spice-wiki.ias.u-psud.fr/doku.php/data:data_analysis_manual>`__.

``sospice`` is intended to be a simple way of accessing all necessary
instrument-specific functionalities required for day-to-day SPICE data analysis,
in complement to more generic Python packages such as
`sunpy <https://sunpy.org/>`__ and
`sunraster <https://github.com/sunpy/sunraster/>`__.

This package is in its early stages of development. Please see the
`issues <https://github.com/solo-spice/sospice/issues>`__ to see how you
can contribute.

Documentation for this package is available on `Read the Docs <https://sospice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.
